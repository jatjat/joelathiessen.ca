Joel Thiessen's Website
=======================

This repository contains a front-end for the [kaly2 project](https://github.com/jatjat/kaly2), my resume, and other content.

The website is implemented as a responsive single-page-app using React and ES6.

I'm indebted to [this tutorial](https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2015/05/15/howto-setup-webpack-on-es6-react-application-with-sass.html) with respect to Webpack.

The current todo list is [here.](/TODO.MD)
