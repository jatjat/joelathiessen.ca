Joel Thiessen's Website
=======================

This website contains a front-end for the [kaly2 project](https://github.com/jatjat/kaly2), my resume, and other content.


I'm indebted to [this tutorial](https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2015/05/15/howto-setup-webpack-on-es6-react-application-with-sass.html) especially with respect to Webpack.

Todo:
  - Refactor robot app inter-object communication for simplicity and directness; maybe by using Redux or Flux
  - Improve resuming robot simulation after browser unsuspension
  - Use protobufs, or a competitor, to minimize websocket connection bandwidth and specify message contracts?
