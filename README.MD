=======================

This website contains a front-end for the [kaly2 project](https://github.com/jatjat/kaly2), my resume, and other content.


I'm indebted to [this](https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2015/05/15/howto-setup-webpack-on-es6-react-application-with-sass.html) tutorial by Jonathan Peticolas especially with respect to Webpack.
